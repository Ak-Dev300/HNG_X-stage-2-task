I have creatd a website that allows a user to search for movies he/she would like to watch and getting details about each movie.
On the "main" route there is a grid layout of top rated movies , each are card components that can be clicked, taking you to a movie details page which is called "MoreInfo" in my source code. 
In the search bar, you can search movies by title, which would return an array of card components as result. This card components can also be clicked to get to the "MoreInfo" component.
In the "MoreInfo" component there is a side bar with some list items, the Home Item is the only functional one with navigation back to the main route "/".
The Website logo also navigates to the "main" component
